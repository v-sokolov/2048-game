# Specification Quality Checklist: Flat-Backed Grid Accessor

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`
- This is an internal engineering refactor; "users" are the engine's developers/maintainers
  and "value" is encapsulation, readability, and bounds-safety, with player-facing behaviour
  held identical (a hard constraint, FR-012/FR-013, SC-001/SC-005).
- Source brief `specs/grid-flat-array-refactor.md` removed after spec generation per request;
  its implementation-level naming and code shapes are intentionally deferred to `/speckit-plan`.
